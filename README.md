## My process

I started by creating the structure with HTML and then applied CSS based on the requirements. As a best practice, I containerized everything using <article> and <section> tags before adding CSS properties to each portion. Media queries were used to ensure the display adapts to different screen sizes.

### What I learned

Most of the CSS properties use tag names to maintain consistency throughout the code. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&family=Young+Serif&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
```

```css
::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: bottom;
}
```
